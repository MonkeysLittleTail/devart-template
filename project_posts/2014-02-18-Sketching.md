Sketching the idea about BiChrom@.


Front view.

The idea is to get closer two distant cultures which collaboration between them 
would not be so easy because of the distance or the costs of it.

Saying the Place A is the Barbican at London and the place B wherever, in this case, our country of origin, Mexico.
Each place/room will be equiped with 3 cameras, 2 projectors, a print, 2 "screens", LED strobes and a one-coloured path.
